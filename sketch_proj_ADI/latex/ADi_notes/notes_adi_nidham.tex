Based on Heather Wilber's notes on Zolotarev numbers, this note aims at redoing proofs and detailing computations of the convergence of the ADI method when solving the Sylvester equation
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Sylvester_eq}
    \mA \mX - \mX \mB = \mC \enspace .
\end{equation}

\section{Convergence of the ADI method}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{ADI error of the iterates}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The ADI iterations are given by
\begin{align}
    &(\mA - p \mI) \mX_{j+1/2} = \mX_{j}(\mB - p \mI) + \mC  \label{eq:adi_1st_step} \\
    &\mX_{j+1}(\mB - q \mI) = (\mA - q \mI)\mX_{j+1/2} - \mC \label{eq:adi_2nd_step} \enspace.
\end{align}

Assuming that there is an unique solution $\mX^*$ to the Sylvester equation \eqref{eq:Sylvester_eq} (for instance if the spectrum of $\mA$ and $\mB$ are separated enough), this solution satisfies the following equation
\begin{align}
    &(\mA - p \mI) \mX^* (\mB - q \mI) - (\mA - q \mI) \mX^* (\mB - p \mI) = (p-q) \mC \nonumber \\
    \Rightarrow &(p-q) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mC (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} - \mX^* = -(\mA - p \mI)^{-1} (\mA - q \mI) \mX^* (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} \label{eq:solution_characteristic}
\end{align}
which directly results from developing the left-hand side and using the fact that $\mX^*$ satisfies \eqref{eq:Sylvester_eq}.

Let us observe that
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:useful_identity}
    (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} - \mI = \left[(\mA - q \mI) - (\mA - p \mI)\right] (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} = (p-q) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1}
\end{equation}

Now, let us combine \eqref{eq:adi_1st_step} and \eqref{eq:adi_2nd_step} to derive the ADI update in one step
\begin{align}
    &\mX_{j+1}(\mB - q \mI) \overset{\eqref{eq:adi_1st_step}+\eqref{eq:adi_2nd_step}}{=} (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mX_{j}(\mB - p \mI) + (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mC - \mC \nonumber \\
    \iff& \mX_{j+1} = (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mX_{j}(\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} + \left[(\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} - \mI\right] \mC (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} \nonumber \\
    \overset{\eqref{eq:useful_identity}}{\iff}& \mX_{j+1} = (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mX_{j}(\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} + (p-q)(\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mC (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} \label{eq:ADI_iteration_one_line}
\end{align}

So, we get the ADI error
\begin{align*}
    &\mX_{j+1} - \mX^* \overset{\eqref{eq:ADI_iteration_one_line}}{=} (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mX_{j}(\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} + (p-q)(\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mC (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} - \mX^* \\
    \Rightarrow &\mX_{j+1} - \mX^* \overset{\eqref{eq:solution_characteristic}}{=} (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mX_{j}(\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} - (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} (\mA - q \mI) \mX^* (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1}
\end{align*}

Finally, the ADI error is the following
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ADI_error}
    \Rightarrow \boxed{\mX_{j+1} - \mX^* = (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} (\mX_{j} - \mX^*) (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1}}
\end{equation}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{ADI error of the residual}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Let us introduce what we call \emph{the residual} of the Sylvester equation~\eqref{eq:Sylvester_eq}
\begin{equation}
    R(\mX) \eqdef \mC - (\mA \mX - \mX \mB)
\end{equation}
We can first observe that
\begin{equation*}
    R(\mX) = \mC - (\mA \mX - \mX \mB) = - \mA (\mX - \mX^*) + (\mX - \mX^*) \mB
\end{equation*}

So, the recurrence relation follows
\begin{align*}
    &R(\mX_{j+1}) \\
    &= - \mA (\mX_{j+1} - \mX^*) + (\mX_{j+1} - \mX^*) \mB \\
    &\overset{\eqref{eq:ADI_error}}{=} - \mA (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} (\mX_{j} - \mX^*) (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} + (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} (\mX_{j} - \mX^*) (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} \mB \\
    &= - (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \mA (\mX_{j} - \mX^*) (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} + (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} (\mX_{j} - \mX^*) \mB (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} \\
    &= (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} \left[- \mA (\mX_{j} - \mX^*) + (\mX_{j} - \mX^*) \mB \right] (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1} \\
    &= (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} R(\mX_{j}) (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1}
\end{align*}

where in the second equality we use that $\mA$, $(\mA - q \mI)$ and $(\mA - p \mI)^{-1}$ commute. The same holds for $\mB$, $(\mB - p \mI)$ and $(\mB - q \mI)^{-1}$.

Finally, the ADI error of the residual (equivalent of suboptimality in optimization) is the following
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ADI_residual_error}
    \Rightarrow \boxed{R(\mX_{j+1}) = (\mA - q \mI) (\mA - p \mI)^{-1} R(\mX_{j}) (\mB - p \mI) (\mB - q \mI)^{-1}}
\end{equation}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The error of the ADI iterates and the residual of the ADI iterates have the same behaviour.
