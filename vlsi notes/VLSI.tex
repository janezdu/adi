The circuit is represented by a matrix of conductivities. What kind of structures might be present in a VLSI chip? The materials seeem to imply that they are dense, but since the actual conductivities are based on the design of chips to be modelled. Given a schematic for a VLSI chip, how do you construct a matrix?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {Model reduction is a topic that comes up frequently. The size of the
  VLSI matrix is so massive that it is only feasible to process it when
  it has been simplified}
\item
  It appears to be linear system, but this is not explicitly verified
  in the slides.
\item
  thermic/electro magnetic effects are what can disturb the signal;
  multilayered chips are a problem. How does this come into play 
  when representing the system?
\item
  Existing methods include Pade approximation, rational interpolation, 
  and rational interpolation. How have these examples been constructed?
\end{itemize}

{Problems/questions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  {I haven't seen a resource that actually verifies that we're modelling
  the effects of a delta signal. The above picture from the stanford
  slides implies it, but only for a toy example}
\item
  {What kind of circuits are represented? Just a network of resistors?
  How do I construct a matrix A such that it represents a realistic VLSI
  system that someone is interested in modelling in modern
  applications?}

  like it's solving the exact opposite problem, using a VLSI chip to
